FEELTHEFOOT
FeelTheFoot is designed for diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) patients to help delay and prevent the development of complications. In order to inhibit aggravation of DPN complications toward amputation, portable Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) system is designed.  Based on the research result that the complications of DPN are mainly caused by the loss of tactile sensation and sensory feedback, I tried to regenerate the patient’s loosened pressure sensation by peripheral stimulation in order to delay the complications. The system reads the pressure distribution from pressure sensor array and generates the modulated stimulation signal containing the information of current pressure distribution to the transcutaneous electrodes. The user would know the foot pressure distribution unconsciously even though his foot does not have the tactile sensation, and I hope that this would lead to recover the sensory feedback mechanism. The result of this prototype has been presented at EMBC ‘2016. Currently further development is ongoing and human-subject test is planned.

 

This project is mentored by Dr. Stephen Deweerth and Ph. D student Hangue Park at Georgia Tech.
