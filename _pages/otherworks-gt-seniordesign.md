REDSS : Remote Escalation/De-escalation and Surveillance System (REDSS)

The senior design project to develop a multi-purpose military autonomous surveillance robot. It is controlled by its remote controller (using custom 2.4 GHz communication) and Android App (using WIFI). It is capable to 1) scan the area and stream the video, 2) broadcast the operatorâ€™s message to the public area, 3) radiate dazzling light to the target by tracking invisible IR laser dot with pan/tilt servo module (in order to inform people to move away from operation area while not revealing where the operator is).
 

Raspberry Pi 3B is used for image processing with openCV coded in C++, and Arduino UNO is used to control hardware peripherals. Remote controller is built with Arduino micro.

 

Team Member : Mike Bossi, Josh Dixon, Gyu Cheol Lim, Satoshi Yuki (ECE Undergraduates at Georgia Tech)

 

This project is sponsored by HARRIS Corporation.
