Project to develop a portable, low-cost (<1$) sleep apnea detection device to measure multi-physiological parameters simultaneously. The system measures ECG, respiration (bio-impedance), galvanic skin response, and airflow to evaluate sleep apnea. I was in charge of designing the filter blocks of four signal measurement components to make them interference-free. The results were published in the 2015 International SoC Design Conference proceedings and presented as an oral presentation.

 

This project is mentored by Dr. SeongHwan Cho at KAIST.
