Surface electromyography (sEMG), the least invasive technique among current peripheral neural interface technologies, is one of the most deeply researched and clinically viable methods for extrinsic neural control of prosthetic devices. Thus, vast amount of research works investigating human biomechanics have relied on a sEMG measurement modality. There also exists many past research works investigating feasibility of neural/extrinsic control of bionic devices (such as bionic prosthesis and exoskeleton) using sEMG. While sEMG has been a well established technology and understood quite thoroughly, deploying sEMG technology for closed-loop control of bionic devices is not trivial due to various technical challenges. Since my Master program in MIT Media Lab, I have been investigating the extended sEMG modality in order to use this technology for closed-loop neural control of bionic devices mainly robotic prosthesis. This encompasses design of hardware and firmware/software of an advanced sEMG platform, as well as new electrode interface and signal processing technique.
