From February 2017 to September 2017, I participated in undergraduate internship program at Naver Labs Robotics group. During the 6 months of intership program, our team developed a small-sized, stand-alone and autonomous mobile robot system for indoor object collection.

We  propose  a  new  methodology  to embed  deep  learning  based  algorithms  in  both  visual  recognition  and  motion  planning  for  general  mobile  robotic  platforms. 

A  framework  for  an  asynchronous  deep  classification  network is  introduced  to  integrate  heavy  deep  classification  networks into  a  mobile  robot  without  losing  system  bandwidth.  

Moreover,  a  gaming  reinforcement  learning-based  motion  planner, a  novel  and  convenient  embodiment  of  reinforcement  learning, is  introduced  for  simple  implementation  and  high  applicability.
